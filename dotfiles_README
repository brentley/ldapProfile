We are now able to store certain custom dot files in ldap.

Currently we support storing .bashrc, .vimrc, .screenrc, 
.tmuxrc, and .bash_logout in ldap.

If additional support is added, this file will be edited.

To protect existing local files from being overwritten,
the ldap version has to be commented with:

# LDAP_STORED_VERSION=X

Where X is the latest version of your file.

Note: doublequote (") is the comment character for .vimrc

By doing this we can ensure you have the latest copy of 
your dot file, and don't overwrite local copies that
may have been customized.

Use the ldap-uploadattribute command to push your 
dot file to the ldap server, and ldap-deleteattribute to 
remove your dot file from the ldap server.

There is currently a 3060 byte limitation per dot file.
